nanotatoR v3.13

Changes:


* Fixed gene_extract bugs with rentrez.

nanotatoR v1.00


Changes:

* Annotation for variants identified by Bionano SV caller for Optical mapping data.
* Features include:
      * Population Frequency calculation using DGV and DECIPHER, as well Bionano Genomics internal cohort of 154 samples from 1000 genomes project.
      * Creates Internal Frequency database using available cohort samples, and calculates frequency for the variants based on that database.
      * Identify genes that overlap and nearest to the breakpoints.
      * Identify genes using phenotype values provided.
      * Exports output in form of Excel, with different tabs with different type of variants.
